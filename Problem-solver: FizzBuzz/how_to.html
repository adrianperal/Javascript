    <h1>Problem-Solver Skill</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Understand: Know exactly what is being asked, explain it in plain
        English.
      </li>
      <li>
        Plan: Plan your solution, analyze the problem and process the
        information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide: Do not try to solve one big problem, break it into sub-problems,
        then, solve each sub-problem one by one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stuck? three things to try when facing a whammy: Debug: Go step by step
        through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Reassess:
        Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there
        anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach? Side-note:
        Another way of reassessing is starting anew.
      </li>
      <li>
        Research: Try Google, no matter what problem you have, someone has
        probably solved it. Do this even if you solved the problem! You can
        learn a lot from other peoples solutions.
      </li>
